## Let's try a command in Python

What do you think will happen if we run this command?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

print("Hello world!")
```

. . .

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

print("Hello world!")
```

## Let's try another command

What do you think will happen if we run this command?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

sum([1, 5, 10])
```

. . .

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: true

sum([1, 5, 10])
```

## Use Python as a basic calculator

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

5 + 1
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

10 - 3
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

2 * 4
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

9 / 3
```

## Comments

</br>

Sometimes we write things in the coding window that we want Python to ignore. These are called comments and start with `#`.

</br>

Python will ignore the comments and just execute the code.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: true

# you can put whatever after #
# for example... blah blah blah
```

::: notes
Si desea escribir un comentario que ocupe más de una línea, es una buena idea poner un \# al principio de cada línea.

## Introduction to functions in Python

</br>

One of the best things about Python is that there are many built-in commands you can use. These are called *functions*.

. . .

Functions have two basic parts:

::: incremental
-   The first part is the name of the function (for example, `sum`).

-   The second part is the input to the function, which goes inside the parentheses (`sum([1, 5, 15])`).
:::

## Python is strict

Python, like all programming languages, is very strict. For example, if you write

```{python}
#| echo: true
sum([1, 100])
```

it will tell you the answer, 101.

. . .

But if you write

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| error: true
Sum([1, 100])
```

with the “s” capitalized, he will act like he has no idea what we are talking about!

::: notes

## Save your work in Python objects

</br>

Virtually anything, including the results of any Python function, can be saved in an *object*.

This is accomplished by using an assignment operator, which can be an equals symbol (`=`).

. . .

You can make up any name you want for a Python object. However, there are two basic rules for this:

::: incremental
1.  It has to be different from a function name in Python.
2.  It has to be as specific as possible.
:::

## For example

</br>

```{python}
#| echo: true

# This code will assign the number 18
# to the object called my_favorite_number

my_favorite_number = 18
```

After running this code, nothing happens. But if we run the object on its own, we can see what's inside it.

```{python}
#| echo: true

my_favorite_number
```

You can also use `print(my_favorite_number)`.

## Lists

</br>

So far we have used Python objects to store a single number. But in statistics we are dealing with variation, which by definition needs more than one number.

. . .

A Python object can also store a complete set of numbers, called a *list*.

You can think of a list as a vector of numbers (or values).

. . .

The `[]` command can be used to combine several individual values into a list.

::: notes
puedes pensar que el c es por combinar
:::

## For example

</br>

This code creates two vectors

```{python}
#| echo: true

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list_2 = [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
```

Let's see its content

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_list
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_list_2
```

## Operations

</br>

We can do simple operations with vectors. For example, we can sum all the elements of a list.

```{python}
#| echo: true

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum(my_list)
```

## Indexing

</br>

We can index a position in the vector using square brackets with a number like this: `[1]`.

So, if we wanted to print the contents of the first position in `my_list`, we could write

```{python}
#| echo: true

my_list[1]
```

[**An feature of Python is that the first element of a list or vector is indexed using the number 0.**]{style="color:red;"}

```{python}
#| echo: true

my_list[0]
```

## A little more about objects in Python

</br>

You can think of Python objects as containers that hold values.

A Python object can hold a single value, or it can hold a group of values (as in a vector).

So far, we've only put numbers into Python objects.

. . .

<br/>

***Python objects can actually contain three types of values: numbers, characters, and booleans.***

## Character values

</br>

Characters are made up of text, such as words or sentences. An example of a list with characters as elements is:

. . .

```{python}
#| echo: true

many_greetings = ["hi", "hello", "hola", "bonjour", "ni hao", "merhaba"]
many_greetings
```

. . .

It is important to know that numbers can also be treated as characters, depending on the context.

For example, when 20 is enclosed in quotes (`"20"`) it will be treated as a character value, even though it encloses a number in quotes.

## Boolean values

</br>

Boolean values are `True` or `False`.

We may have a question like:

-   Is the first element of the vector `many_greetings` `"hola"`?

. . .

We can ask Python to find out and return the answer `True` or `False`.

```{python}
#| echo: true

many_greetings[1] == "hola"
```

## Logical operators

</br>

Most of the questions we ask Python to answer with `True` or `False` involve comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `==`.

The double `==` sign checks whether two values are equal. There is even a comparison operator to check whether values are *not* equal: `!=`.

For example, `5 != 3` is a `True` statement.

## Common logical operators

</br>

-   `>` (*larger than*)

-   `>=` (*larger than or equal to*)

-   `<` (*smaller than*)

-   `<=` (*smaller than or equal to*)

-   `==` (*equal to*)

-   `!=` (*not equal to*)

## Question

</br>

Read this code and predict its response. Then, run the code in Google Colab and validate if you were correct.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

A = 1
B = 5
compare = A > B
compare
```

## Programming culture: Trial and error

</br>

The best way to learn programming is to try things out and see what happens. Write some code, run it, and think about why it didn't work.

There are many ways to make small mistakes in programming (for example, typing a capital letter when a lowercase letter is needed).

We often have to find these mistakes through trial and error.

## Python libraries

</br>

Libraries are the fundamental units of reproducible Python code. They include reusable Python functions, documentation describing how to use them, and sample data.

In this course, we will be working mostly with the following libraries:

-   `pandas` for data manipulation
-   `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
-   `statsmodels` and `scikit-learn` for data modelling

# Reading data with Python

## Data organization

In data science, we organize data into rows and columns.

::: center
```         
    Condition  Age   Wt    Wt2
1  Uninformed   35  136  135.8
2  Uninformed   45  162  161.8
3    Informed   52  117  116.8
4    Informed   29  184  182.8
5  Uninformed   38  134  136.6
6    Informed   39  189  183.2
```
:::

. . .

The rows are the sampled cases. In this example, the rows are housekeepers from different hotels. There are six rows, so there are six housekeepers in this data set.

. . .

Depending on the study, the rows could be people, states, couples, mice—any case you're taking a sample from to study.

## 

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The columns represent variables or attributes of each case that were measured.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```         
    Condition  Age   Wt    Wt2
1  Uninformed   35  136  135.8
2  Uninformed   45  162  161.8
3    Informed   52  117  116.8
4    Informed   29  184  182.8
5  Uninformed   38  134  136.6
6    Informed   39  189  183.2
```
:::
:::::

. . .

<br/>

In this study, housekeepers were either informed or not that their daily work of cleaning hotel rooms was equivalent to getting adequate exercise for good health.

. . .

<br/>

So one of the variables, `Condition`, indicates whether they were informed of this fact or not.

## 

Other variables include the age of the housekeeper (`Age`), her weight before starting the study (`Wt`), and her weight at the end of the study (`Wt2`), measured four weeks later.

<br/>

Therefore, the values in each row represent the values of that particular case in each of the variables measured.

```         
    Condition  Age   Wt    Wt2
1  Uninformed   35  136  135.8
2  Uninformed   45  162  161.8
3    Informed   52  117  116.8
4    Informed   29  184  182.8
5  Uninformed   38  134  136.6
6    Informed   39  189  183.2
```

## Loading data in Python

In this course, we will assume that data is stored in an Excel file with the above organization. As an example, let's use the file `penguins.xlsx`.

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/print_excel.png){width="418"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/clipboard-1776523589.png){width="396"}
:::
:::::

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
[***The file must be previously uploaded to Google Colab.***]{style="color:red;"}
:::

## 

The dataset `penguins.xlsx` contains data from penguins living in three islands.

## pandas library

</br>

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/pandas-logo-300.png){fig-align="left"}
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   **pandas** is an open-source Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
-   It is built on top of **numpy** for high-performance data operations..
-   It allows the user to import, clean, transform, and analyze data efficiently
-   <https://pandas.pydata.org/>
:::
:::::

## Importing pandas

Fortunately, the **pandas** library is already pre-installed in Google Colab.

</br>

However, we need to inform Google Colab that we want to use **pandas** and its functions using the following command:

```{python}
#| echo: true

import pandas as pd
```

</br>

The command `as pd` allows us to have a short name for **pandas**. To use a function of **pandas**, we use the command `pd.function()`.

## Loading data using pandas

</br>

The following code shows how to read the data in the file "penguins.xlsx" into Python.

```{python}
#| echo: true

# Load the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.
penguins_data = pd.read_excel("penguins.xlsx")
```

## The function head()

The function `head()` allows you to print the first rows of a pandas data frame.

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Print the first 4 rows of the dataset.
penguins_data.head(4)
```

## Indexing variables a dataset

We can select a specific variables of a data frame using the syntaxis below.

```{python}
#| echo: true

penguins_data['bill_length_mm']
```

Here, we selected the variable `bill_length_mm` in the `penguins_data` dataset.

## 

To index multiple variables of a data frame, we put the names of the variables in a list object. For example, we select `bill_length_mm`, `species`, and `island` as follows:

```{python}
#| echo: true

sub_penguins_data = penguins_data[ ['bill_length_mm',  'species', 'island'] ]
sub_penguins_data.head()
```

## Indexing rows

To index rows in a dataset, we use the argument `loc` from **pandas**. For example, we select the rows 3 to 6 of the `penguins_dataset` dataset:

```{python}
#| echo: true

rows_penguins_data = penguins_data.loc[2:5]
rows_penguins_data
```

## 

</br>

```{python}
#| echo: true

rows_penguins_data
```

Note that the index 2 and 5 refer to observations 3 and 7, respectively, in the dataset. This is because the first index in Python is 0.

## Indexing rows and columns

Using `loc`, we can also retrieve a subset from the dataset by selecting specific columns and rows.

```{python}
#| echo: true

sub_rows_pdata = penguins_data.loc[2:5, ['bill_length_mm',  'species', 'island'] ]
sub_rows_pdata
```
