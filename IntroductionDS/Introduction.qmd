# Introduction to data science

## Data science is ...

a multidisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data.

## In 2004 ...

Hurricane Frances was sweeping through the Caribbean and threatening to make a direct hit on Florida's Atlantic coast.

Residents headed for higher ground, but in Arkansas, Wal-Mart executives saw a big opportunity for one of their newest data-driven weapons: ***predictive technology***.

A week before the storm made landfall, Linda M. Dillman, Wal-Mart's chief information officer, pressed her staff to create forecasts based on what had happened when Hurricane Charley hit several weeks earlier.

<br/>

Backed by trillions of bytes of shopper history stored in Wal-Mart’s data warehouse, she said, the company could “start predicting what’s going to happen, rather than waiting for it to happen,” as she put it.

## The scheme of data science

![](images/clipboard-4096324521.png){fig-align="center"}

## Business understanding

</br>

-   Business understanding refers to defining the business problem to be solved.

-   The goal is to reframe the business problem as a data science problem.

-   Often, reframing the problem and designing a solution is an iterative process.

## Common data science problems

</br>

[**Regression**]{style="color:blue;"} attempts to estimate or predict, for each individual, the numerical value of some variable for that individual. For example, “How much will a given customer use the service?”

. . .

[**Classification**]{style="color:green;"} (or class probability estimation) attempts to predict, for each individual in a population, which of a (small) set of classes this individual belongs to. For example, “Among all customers of T-Mobile, which are likely to respond to a given offer?”

## Other problems

</br></br>

**Clustering** attempts to group individuals in a population together by their similarity, but not driven by any specific purpose. For example, “Do our customers form natural groups or segments?”

## Discussion

</br>

-   Often, recasting the problem and designing a solution is an iterative process.

-   The initial formulation may not be complete or optimal, so multiple iterations may be necessary for an acceptable solution formulation.

-   They key to a great success is a creative problem formulation by some analyst regarding how to cast the business problem as one or more data science problems.

## Data understanding I

</br>

::: incremental
-   If the goal is to solve a business problem, the data that makes up the raw material available from which the solution will be built.

-   The available data rarely matches the problem.

-   For example, historical data is often collected for purposes unrelated to the current business problem or for no explicit purpose at all.
:::

## Data understanding II

</br>

-   The costs of data vary. Some data will be available for free while others will require effort to obtain.

::: incremental
-   A critical part of the data understanding phase is estimating the costs and benefits of each data source and deciding wether further investment is merited.

-   Even after all datasets are acquired, collating them may require additional effort.

## Numerical data

</br>

Data science methodology is based on numerical data given in tables.

> In fact, texts, images, videos or audios are transformed into this format to process them.

# Basic notation and terminology

## Notation and terminology

</br>

Explanatory variables or predictors:

-   $X$ represents an explanatory variable or predictor.
-   $\boldsymbol{X} = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p)$ represents a whole collection of $p$ predictors.

Outcome or response:

-   $Y$ represents the response variable, which we’ll try to predict.

## Two main problems

</br>

[**Regression problems**]{style="color:blue;"}. The response $Y$ is quantitative. For example, a person’s income, the value of a house, the blood pressure of a patient.

[**Classification problems**]{style="color:green;"}. The response $Y$ is qualitative and has $K$ different categories. For example, the brand of a product purchased (A, B, C), or whether a person defaults on a debt (yes or no).

The predictors ($\boldsymbol{X}$) can be qualitative or quantitative.

## Example

</br></br>

What factors explain the presence of Type II diabetes on a person?

-   $Y$ is a 1 if a person has Type II diabetes, a 0 if not.

-   The predictors ($\boldsymbol{X}$) might include: income, zip code, age, weight, height, gender and race.

## A statistical model

</br>

A **statistical model** is a mathematical equation that embodies statistical assumptions concerning the generation of *data*.

Technically, it has the following form:

$$Y = f(\boldsymbol{X}) + \epsilon $$

where $Y$ is a quantitative response, $f(\boldsymbol{X})$ is the function that relates the predictors, $\boldsymbol{X}$, to the $Y$, and $\epsilon$ is the (random) error term.

## True and estimated models

</br>

$f(\boldsymbol{X})$ represents the TRUTH. The true relationship between $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $Y$.

-   Unknown
-   Very complex

. . .

$\hat{f}(\boldsymbol{X})$ represents an approximation or estimate of the true model constructed using data.

-   Ideally, interpretable (but not necessarily)

## Two datasets

-   “Training” data are data used to construct $\hat{f}(\boldsymbol{X})$.

-   “Testing” data are data that were NOT used in the fitting process, but are used to test how well your model performs on unseen data.
